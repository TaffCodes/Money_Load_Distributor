# Money_Load_Distributor
A simple Python program to facilitate splitting money while operating as a money bag.

The program captures the initial amount of cash received and allocates 95% to the loader. 
The money bags, in this case, two chains are factored with each receiving half of the 5% that remains after subtracting transaction fees to the loader.
The money sent to money bag 1 has its transaction charges subtracted.
The last money bag in the chain receives their rightful 2.5% after subtraction of the initial transaction cost to the loader.
The transaction charges are subject to the rates published from time for M-PESA by Safaricom PLC on https://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/mpesa-charges .
I do not hold any liability for the use of this program. Any malicious use with intent to defraud is solely on the user of the program.
HAPPY CODING!
